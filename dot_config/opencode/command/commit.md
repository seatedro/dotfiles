commit using jujutsu

make sure it includes a prefix like
docs({project}):
feat({project}):
chore({project}):
ci({project}):
ignore({project}):
wip({project}):

For anything in the typescript/vulcan/vulcan folder use vulcan for project name.
For anything in the typescript/vulcan/vulcan/src/vql folder use vql for project name.

Follow the above pattern for the other sub dirs.

prefer to explain WHY something was done from an end user perspective instead of
WHAT was done.

do not do generic messages like "improved agent experience" be very specific
about what user facing changes were made

if there are conflicts DO NOT FIX THEM. notify me and I will fix them
